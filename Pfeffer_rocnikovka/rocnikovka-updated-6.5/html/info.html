                Started training in 2021, currently has more than a year of experience in world of pro wrestling. Since VcV Megashow 8, where he fought his trainer Ezény in 3-on-1 handicap match, he is a big part of VcV ORIGINAL WRESTLING roster. Still improving in the ring, Šimon has a very extensive move-set, with his signature moves being  diving crossbody, running knee, three amigos, running senton, shotgun dropkick and more. Šimon wrestled veterans like R.J Kolda to win his first championship in his career, the VcV Hardcore championship, which he held for two times for about 40 days. Šimon also has experience in matches like Royal Rumble, which he entered as number 2 where he lasted over 15 minutes. He wrestled in a 10-man elimination tag match and on the biggest wrestling show in history of VcV, Megashow 9, he and his best friend and tag team partner Christian faced returning VcV legend Démon. They lost but that didnt stopped their momentum and at next show, VcV TIME OF HATE, at 27.4. 2024, Šimon participated in a 5-man Scrumble match for VcV Gold in Case. Even tho the wasnt the biggest favorite, the fans were behind him and they wanted Šimon to win. After his awesome performance, he almost won after pinning Lord Ian with running knee, sadly Patriot came in and attacked Šimon with a glass bottle and defeated him. Even tho he lost again, his start shines brighter than ever and he is ready to overcome every challange before which he is placed. Šimon now being baby face can work as a heel too. He is able to wrestle in many kinds of matches. He can take wins and losses and he is more than ready to make the best show for you! If you are intrested, go on Contacts and contact me via email, instagram, messenger or discord. I'm looking forward to our cooperation.
